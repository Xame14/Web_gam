				<h1>Welcome to the Black Jack page</h1>
				<p>Blackjack, also known as 21, is a popular card game played in casinos around the world. The objective is to beat the dealer by having a hand value closer to 21 without exceeding it.</p>
				<p> </p>
				<p>Key Elements:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<p>1. <b>Gameplay: </b></p>
						<ul>
							<li>Each player is dealt two cards, and the dealer receives one card face up and one face down.</li>
							<li>Players can choose to "hit" (take another card) or "stand" (keep their current hand) to improve their total.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>2. <b>Card Values: </b></p>
						<ul>
							<li>Number cards (2-10) are worth their face value.</li>
							<li>Face cards (Kings, Queens, Jacks) are worth 10.</li>
							<li>Aces can be worth 1 or 11, depending on which value benefits the hand.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>3. <b>Winning Hands: </b></p>
						<ul>
							<li>Players win by having a higher hand value than the dealer without going over 21 (busting).</li>
							<li>If a player busts, they lose their bet immediately.</li>
							<li>If the dealer busts, remaining players win.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>4. <b>Blackjack: </b></p>
						<ul>
							<li>A player with an Ace and a 10-value card (a "blackjack") wins automatically unless the dealer also has a blackjack, resulting in a push (tie).</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>5. <b>Betting Options: </b></p>
						<ul>
							<li>Players can double their bet after receiving their initial two cards or split pairs into two separate hands.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>6. <b>House Edge: </b></p>
						<ul>
							<li>The game has a relatively low house edge, especially with optimal play, making it attractive to players.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ol>
				<p>Blackjack is a blend of chance and strategy, appealing to both casual players and serious gamblers alike.</p>
